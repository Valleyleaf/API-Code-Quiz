## Description

This project was created as my first Javascript project that was completed without any pre-existing code. When I started working on this project, I was looking to do a dynamic quiz that would randomize not only the order of the questions, but also the order of the answers, and which answers were available aside from the "correct" answer. I sadly ran into a wall with my original code (Refer to Script - Copy.js) and was forced to abandon it due to time constraints. I tried to simplify my code but contined to run into issues that
made my code more and more complex. I believe that with a bit more time, I would have been able to produce a quality script. What I have learned from this project is three things.

1. The importance of psudo-coding. I made some basic psudo-code on where certain functions were to go, only to realise I had greatly underestimated the amount of functions needed (See Script -Copy.js as it has very bloated functions). Going forward, I need to plan my projects better.

2. Pre-work. I need to create a framework styling to use for my index and Style. This will save me time for my scripts instead of doing everything from scratch each time.

3. Naming conventions. I need to pre-plan what names to use and where. I often ran into issues where I was using the same name for both a function and a global variable which caused a lot of frustration and lost time.
